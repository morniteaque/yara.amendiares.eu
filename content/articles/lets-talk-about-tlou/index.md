I don't usually write about what I think, or feel about a series or a movie but The Last of US is a pretty special case and makes me want to write some lines about it. I'm not an audiovisual expert, scriptwriter, or any other bullshit like that, I'm just a huge fan of the game universe.

Like many people, I discovered TLOU in June 2013 with its release on PS3. From the very first minutes, I was addicted to this game with its relatively simple story but its very touching way of telling the story. TLOU is not a simple zombie game with a dark and mysterious origin. The origin of the epidemic is quite unique for a zombie game, the story highlights the role of "cordyceps", a kind of mushroom that actually exists in real life. The particularity of these fungi is that they take over the host, mostly ants, and spread by throwing spores. For the time being, these fungi cannot survive in a human host, except in TLOU, which caused the collapse of humanity.

When HBO officially presented the project to make a series on TLOU, I was very confused, I didn't really know what to think about it and what to expect. Yet, I am a huge fan of the universe, I have played both games several times ( not forgetting the wonderful DLC). I've always been afraid, for no reason, of video game adaptations in series or movies, even though I enjoyed the Cyberpunk adaptation in anime. During the wait between the formal announcement of the series and the first trailer, and until the announcement of the release date of the series, I didn't try to get any information about the series.

I carried on with my life without thinking about it until the announcement of the casting. I must admit that I was very happy to see Pedro Pascal in the role of Joel, he is an actor that I liked very much in Narcos and in The Mandalorian. In the case of Bella Ramsey, I had my doubts, I didn't know this actress at all since I never watched Game of Thrones. But I know that my friends who watched the show liked her character, so I felt a little bit more confident in this adaptation without telling me that it would be the show of the year, I was expecting something good but that's all.

When the first episode was released, it was very late in Europe (3 am) but I really didn't want to waste more time watching the episode, especially since a few days before, we still didn't have an official release date with the name of the broadcaster for France. Anyway, I was in my bed, I launch the episode and from the first minutes of the episode, I didn't recognize the first minutes of the game. The game starts at night when the series starts in the morning. The series makes us see the beginning of the end, and how the day goes before the end of the world. We spend the day with Joel's daughter Sarah, we see Joel's brother Tommy, and the series finally gives us an explanation as to why Joel leaves the house at night and then returns, while the world is turning upside down, to pick up Sarah at home.

The backgrounds are beautiful, and the scenes are sublime. But I read a lot of negative things about the scene of Sarah's death, a lot of racist things, and a lot of purists of the game could not conceive that the series could take some liberties with the original work and adapt some things, like Sarah's daughter, who goes from a white child in the game to a mixed race child in the series. This does not change the complicity between Joel and his daughter in the first episode, especially since, as in the game, we have no information about Sarah's mother. Episode 1 shows us in its second part, the establishment 20 years later of a military regime, authoritarian and deprivation of freedom in the name of the fight against ... the end of the world?

More seriously, I could write for hours about what I thought of episode 1 and episode 2. But to make it simple, one of the things I particularly liked was some small details that we didn't have in the game. For example, the fact the epidemic started in Indonesia, following the mutation of the fungus that infected flour and other foods, the fact that we know how long it takes a person to transform depending on where he was bitten, and other small details that I will not mention so as not to spoil more

Now let's talk about why I'm writing this. Episode 3, which came out on January 30, 2023. At first, I wanted to write something at the end of the series but today's episode really turned me off. The episode was written by Craig Mazin and not by Neil Druckman, the writer of the games. The episode is really different from the story of the video game, in the game we go to the place where Bill, an old acquaintance of Joel, lives. This quest has a purpose: to get a battery to recover a vehicle and bring Ellie back to the fireflies. We meet Bill for the first time in a special situation, Joel has fallen into a trap of Bill, who has secured an entire city against the infected. Ellie tries to help him but in the end, Bill arrives and saves Joel and Ellie's lives. The relationship is quite tense between Ellie and Bill, they argue and don't seem to like each other but who cares, they won't stay long, just long enough to go and collect a battery from an abandoned school and leave. In the game, we subtly learn about Bill's homosexuality and his "friend" Frank's betrayal, but we don't learn more.

In the series, the scenario is completely different, but the changes are positive, to my surprise. We can see the first meeting between Bill and Frank, and the evolution of their relationship, at the beginning Bill did not want to save the life of this man, alone and abandoned by himself but he decides to welcome him to his home, feed him, and take care of him. They have a sincere and simple relationship.

Bill who is presented as a very vulgar person in the game gives way to a sensitive and human person in the series. The two of them often fight but in the end, love wins. One scene particularly touched me, the one where Frank is invited by Bill's radio, and two strangers to come to dinner, which contrasts very strongly with the very survivalist and careful character of Bill. The fact that the two strangers invited by Frank are Joel and Tess, is very touching. We see two duos; Frank and Tess and Joel and Bill. We see them eating at a table, in a garden in front of a house, they are carefree, we would almost forget that it is the end of the world, and we would believe to see a banal scene of normal life. In the rest of the episode, we see Bill getting older and Frank getting seriously ill, to the point of wanting to commit suicide to put an end to his suffering. Frank ends up marrying Bill and commits suicide at the end of the day. Contrary to the game, Bill decides to commit suicide with Frank and leaves a letter to Joel and... Tess, without knowing that she is dead and that from now on Joel has a new partner, well, a cargo: Ellie.

The direction is so touching, when I saw the end of the episode, I thought that Joel and Tess should have grown old together like Frank and Bill and died together but of course, that wouldn't fit the rest of the game's storyline. This is probably, without going into it, the episode that has been the most modified from the original story but in a very emotional and successful way. We finally get out of the game's scenario, we don't know what to expect and finally, the most beautiful surprise is to be surprised by the unknown. During the first two episodes, I always knew what was going to happen scene after scene, this was not the case in episode 3 and I sincerely thank Craig Mazin for that. They managed to go beyond the narrative and emotion of the game and that's the biggest achievement of this episode and maybe the series, looking forward to the sequel every Monday.
