> "I also know that many of our fellow citizens voted for me today not to support the ideology I represent, but to block the ideas of the far right."

These words are those pronounced by Emmanuel Macron on the evening of Sunday, April 25, 2022 in Paris to celebrate his re-election in the presidential election against Marine Le Pen. Since that date, many things have changed for Emmanuel Macron: the loss of his absolute majority in the legislative elections of June 2022, the historic score of the National Rally of Marine Le Pen in the legislative elections, the inflationary crisis and especially the pension reform.

The beginning of the new legislature, without an absolute majority for the presidential party, was illustrated by the refusal of the party Les Républicains to agree with Emmanuel Macron on the formation of a government contract for the next 5 years, despite the fact that Les Républicains is the political party (represented in the National Assembly) ideologically closest to the presidential party.

This refusal by the Republicans leaves Emmanuel Macron with only three options for governing: negotiate with the parliamentary groups for each bill tabled by the government, dissolve the National Assembly and therefore call for new legislative elections, or use a very controversial provision of the constitution to pass a bill without a vote by the deputies, the "49;3" article. If the first laws passed by the new Assembly were thanks to the votes of the deputies of the Republicans and the National Rally, the situation deteriorated greatly during the examination of the most important law for a government, the budget. By definition, the budget bill is the most political bill a government can introduce because it authorizes the state to raise taxes and, more importantly, to spend that money to fund its programs. It is therefore not surprising to see resistance from opposition members, except that the government needs the votes of these opposition members, at least those of the Republicans, to pass its budget bill. The government, not having succeeded in seducing the right-wing opposition, and not wanting to compromise with them, has decided to use the "49;3" article, this article engages the responsibility of the government before the National Assembly and if the latter does not adopt a motion of censure, then the law proposed by the government is considered as adopted, without a vote of the deputies.

From 1958 to 2022, the "49;3" has been used 99 times by several governments and 10 times by the government of Elizabeth Borne, who was appointed Prime Minister only a few months earlier. The use of this article by the Borne government has the sole purpose of reducing the political weight of the National Assembly, at a time when it should normally have the importance it deserves in this configuration.

The most shocking thing for me is not what happened in the National Assembly in the spring with the budget but what is happening right now with Emmanuel Macron's very unpopular pension reform, which is mainly aimed at shifting the retirement age to 64. Emmanuel Macron said it in April but has surely forgotten it since then, many people voted in the second round of the presidential election to prevent the election of Marine le Pen as president. This desire to block the election was confirmed a few months later, in June, with the loss of her absolute majority in the legislative elections. Yet Emmanuel Macron persists in saying that this reform is "democratically validated". However, 72% of French people say they are opposed to it, but more worrying for Emmanuel Macron, 52% of Emmanuel Macron's voters in the second round also say they are opposed to the pension reform proposed by his government. What the management of the pension reform by the government and Emmanuel Macron demonstrates is that in France, there is no culture of compromise. The alignment of the legislative election calendar with that of the presidential election calendar, in addition to the electoral system for legislative elections, has killed French parliamentarianism. The deputies do not listen to each other, the government does not listen to the deputies and, above all, the President despises the deputies. It is not really Emmanuel Macron's fault, he inherited a system where the presidential function is considered as that of a republican monarch who would have all the powers because of his victory in the presidential election, which influences those of the legislative elections.

So, what are the solutions for France to regain its love of parliamentarianism and join the democratic standard of other European countries? Change the voting system for the legislative elections, at least not to organize legislative elections after the presidential election, reduce the powers of the President of the Republic (or abolish the function).
