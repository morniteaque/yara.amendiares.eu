Emmanuel Macron had already tried to reform the institutions during his term of office, an attempt quickly aborted by the blocking of the various opposition groups in the National Assembly after the revelations of the newspaper "Le Monde" on the beginning of a political-judicial affair that will quickly become the Benalla case.

Macron consulted former Presidents Sarkozy and Hollande, he wishes to set up a transparent commission whose mission will be to bring a reflection to the President on the future of our institutions. While waiting for the launching of this commission and the proposals retained by Emmanuel Macron, I also have, as a citizen, proposals and reflections to make. He had made several promises during his 2017 election campaign: to reduce the number of parliamentarians, to abolish the Court of Justice of the Republic and especially to introduce a "dose" of proportional representation for legislative elections. Once again, Macron does not go far enough, he puts a band-aid on a wound that needs a real treatment to heal. Reducing the number of parliamentarians would not only contribute to the lack of representation of citizens in Parliament, but also reduce the effectiveness of Parliament in doing its job properly of making law and overseeing the action of the government, not to mention reducing diversity. On the contrary, we need more representativeness, and it is necessary to introduce a proportional system, so that finally, each citizen can vote not strategically but by adhesion. The proposal of a simple dose of proportional representation is disappointing, it would not allow a fair representation of political parties and voters in parliament and will continue to provide false majorities to the government. The advantage of full proportional representation is that it favours minority governments and therefore encourages compromise and work between the different political parties. Another anomaly that we must repair is the alignment of the calendar between the presidential election and the legislative elections, which also gives a false majority to the president. To address this anomaly, it would be wise to lengthen the presidential term of office to 6 years, while reducing the term of deputies from 5 to 3 years. This reduction of the deputy's mandate will allow citizens to evaluate and assess the first part of the mandate of their representatives by allowing them to choose whether or not to renew their confidence in them. This reduction would also encourage the government to be attentive to citizens' expectations.
One of the big projects is also the reform of the Senate - it is no longer acceptable to have a chamber composed of people not directly elected by the people. I do not have a firm opinion on this issue yet, but the only certainty I have is that the senators must be elected by the citizens, but the question of the duration of the mandate, of the voting system and these are questions to which I do not have any answers yet.

The reform of the institutions is not a simple reform like the others, in its finality, it gives a functioning to our democracy and that is why we should not waste this opportunity to make a beautiful and great reform. Let's give back to France a beautiful parliamentary democracy, a better representation in the Parliament to the citizens and let's stop the drifts of the majority governments.
