In the modern political landscape, digital social media play an essential role in communication between politicians and their constituents. However, accessibility remains one of the big losers in this development. Unfortunately, many European politicians are not taking advantage of the accessibility features offered by digital platforms, which not only excludes whole sections of society, but also poses a major democratic problem.
The failure to take account of online accessibility excludes a significant segment of the population: people with disabilities. Unadapted content on social media creates barriers for those with specific visual and hearing needs. This failure to take accessibility into account not only limits participation in the online public sphere, but also restricts the variety of opinions that fuel public debate.

Our democracies are based on the idea that every voice counts and should be heard. However, by not providing accessible online content, politicians and their teams are distorting this notion. Digital social media have become the new public square, but some voices are being silenced because of a lack of understanding of accessibility issues by our politicians and their teams. This is a problem of democratic representation and not just a technical one, because the solutions exist.

Politicians, as the initiators of online political debate, must set an example by adopting inclusive practices. By being diligent in creating accessible content, politicians are sending out a clear message about their commitment to a democracy that is truly open to all.

Now, what are the practical solutions for improving the lack of accessibility in our politicians' communications? It's not enough to train the staff who manage communications; our politicians also need to work with experts to train themselves and better comply with standards. Citizens also have a role to play: soliciting politicians who do not use accessibility mechanisms by contacting them on social media or via their emails. Accessibility in political communication is much more than a mere technical detail. It is an essential pillar of democracy. By choosing not to attach importance to online accessibility, European politicians run the risk of marginalizing entire groups of citizens and compromising the true equality of voices in the political process. Genuinely democratic political communication must embrace accessibility as a fundamental value.
