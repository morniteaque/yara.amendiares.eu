I'm writing these lines several days after Nahel's death, when I'm suffering from insomnia in the middle of the night-time riots. The loss of Nahel is a tragedy that resonates with me, even though she is a very different person from me. I don't use a hire car without a licence, but I share the same skin colour and ethnic origins with him. When you're from North Africa, you're often confronted with racial profiling and incessant comments about your nationality and origins. You're constantly relegated to the status of second-class citizen. Talking about my origins makes me feel uncomfortable, a feeling fuelled by the racist experiences I've had. It wasn't until I was at secondary school that I became aware of racism, when a teacher once said to me: "You're well dressed for an Arab". It was then that I was deeply shocked and saddened by such a comment. Since then, I've hardly been able to ignore these situations: the suspicious looks I get from police officers in the street, the many times I'm turned down for work placements or student jobs when I use my Maghrebi first name. Nahel's death is shocking, but not surprising. In France, police officers know that they are protected by the system. The police and their unions are powerful, and the justice system is complacent. We might mention the case of Bouzid Saal, killed in French Algeria by a policeman for waving an Algerian flag, Lahouri Ben Mohamed, killed during a traffic stop by a young policeman, or Malik Oussekine. Each time, the police officers were given short sentences, as if their lives did not matter.

How can you not be angry when politicians like Darmanin deny the existence of police violence? I'll never forget what he said, never. Daring to say "I choke when I hear about police violence" after the death of CÃ©dric Chouviat, asphyxiated by a police officer. In another country, a minister would have resigned over such comments. As I write these lines, no politician has risen to the challenge. I think that rioters destroying property, whether private or public, is intolerable and unacceptable, but it is a way for people who have no other means to make their voices heard.

I'd like to hear a politician talk about what really matters: punishing police officers who are at fault, making the IGPN, the institution responsible for judging police officers, independent, suspending police officers from the first report of violence, making it compulsory to always wear cameras, and increasing the legal penalties for police officers who lie and commit violence.
